badger is a tool that helps you filter large folders of photos. It:

- Copies media into a directory, with photos / video clustered together by the time they were taken
- Updates photo names with an estimate of how blurry they are, so you can sort from likey sharpest to blurriest within a burst of photos.
- Flattens the final selection of media (after you delete what you don't want to keep) into a folder ready to upload.

## Usage

```bash
badger copy --from '/media/rg/3236-3061/DCIM/**/*' --to '/home/rg/Desktop/resources' --max-seconds-diff 4
```
